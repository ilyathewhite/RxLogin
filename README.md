# RxLogin, a simulation of a login form with RxSwift

Gives an example of using rxSwift and rxCocoa in an iOS app. Some highlights:

- the code is very declarative
- the model captures all the app logic
- the controller code is very simple and short. All of the complexity is in the model.
- unification of target / action, delegate, and completion / callback patterns
- much less code, built with generic building blocks
